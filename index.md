## About Me
As a trained chemical engineer, I'm working to explore computational neuroscience, non-linear dynamics, electrohydrodynamics, and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Current Work
#### _Effect of Electric Field on Neuronal Cells_
In my current project, I'm investigating the effects of external electric fields on neuronal cells, including electroporation and coupling of mechanics and electric stresses through computation of neuronal circuits and examining the interplay of the action potential, voltage signaling, resting potential, and transmembrane potential in the neuronal membrane.
