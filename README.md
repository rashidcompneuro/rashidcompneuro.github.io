## Md. Rashid Ali Faridi

I am a Ph.D. scholar in the Department of Chemical Engineering at IIT Bombay. My work involves modelling single and multiple neuronal assemblies to see their response to external stimuli.

As a trained chemical engineer, I'm working to explore computational neuroscience, non-linear dynamics, electrohydrodynamics, and neurodegenerative diseases.

My supervisor is [Prof. Rochish M. Thaokar](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/faculty/rochish-madhukar-thaokar), a senior professor at IIT Bombay working in the areas of [fluid mechanics, soft matter, and electrohydrodynamics](https://rochishthaokar.wixsite.com/mysite).

I have a teaching experience of more than 6 years.

## Current Work
#### _Effect of Electric Field on Neuronal Cells_
In my current project, I'm investigating the effects of external electric fields on neuronal cells, including electroporation and coupling of mechanics and electric stresses through computation of neuronal circuits and examining the interplay of the action potential, voltage signaling, resting potential, and transmembrane potential in the neuronal membrane.
